  <p>
    I am a research affiliate at the
    MIT Media Lab,
    advised by <a href="https://pliang279.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Paul Liang</a>, and a research assistant at
    Johns Hopkins University, working with
    <a href="https://www.haofrankyang.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Hao Frank Yang</a> and
    <a href="https://hongru94.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Hongru Du</a>.
    My research explores the intersection of <strong>multimodal large language models</strong>, <strong>human-centered AI</strong>,
    and <strong>intelligent transportation systems</strong>, aiming to build AI that understands and generates human reactions, decisions,
    and behaviors in complex social and physical environments.
    I completed my B.S. in Computer Science at
    Tongji University in 3.5 years, working with
    <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37407069800" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Yufei Chen</a> and
    <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085342733" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Peng Qi</a> on medical imaging and robotics.
    In March 2023, I joined Microsoft as a full-time software engineer and spent 1.5 years in
    Azure Workflow, where I built large-scale distributed services, developing strong foundations in algorithmic implementation, and interdisciplinary collaboration.
    I am currently seeking <strong>Ph.D. opportunities starting Fall 2026</strong> in the areas of multimodal large language models, human-centered AI, and intelligent systems.
